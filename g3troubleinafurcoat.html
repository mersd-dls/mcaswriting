I stretched and rolled over. It felt as if I had been asleep forever. It was hard to pry my eyes open, but I could hear something moving next to me. I wanted to see what was going on.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span>&nbsp;Mother was up on her feet, stretching her legs. Her sharp ears were perked forward to catch the faintest sound. I heard other sounds, too.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span>&nbsp;Then my mother did the strangest thing. With one large, clawed paw, she reached out and swatted at the wall before her. It moved. Suddenly, there was a small opening at the end of our den. Bushes and leaves had been shoved aside.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">4</span>&nbsp;Mother stopped and sniffed and listened again. Then she went to work once more. She was working to make the opening even larger.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">5</span>&nbsp;For a moment, my eyes could not stand the sudden brightness. I looked away, blinking. It was then that I noticed my sister.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Kimwa</span> was curled up in a corner, her back against the dirt wall. Her eyes were huge in her small face, and she looked scared. That was when I giggled.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">7</span>&nbsp;“<span class="ssml-sub:Shush" id="KqQlq">Shhh</span>” came Mother’s sharp voice. I bit my tongue and scurried out of her reach.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;Mother waited for a few moments, sniffing and listening. I backed into one corner, and my little sister crouched in another. We weren’t sure what was going on.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;Then Mother slowly stepped forward. Her big head rolled from side to side. Her nose lifted even higher. She shifted her weight slightly from one foot to another. After a long time, she stepped back in the den.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;“It’s time,” she said softly.</p> <p class="center"><span class="abbi-hiddentts">* * *</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;I could not believe my eyes. Just outside of our den was the most incredible sight one could imagine. For a moment I thought I was dreaming. Then I heard Kimwa let out her breath in a long, deep sigh as she said, “Oooh.” And I knew that what I was seeing must be real.</p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tn8items_convert/items/285/bdbdcefe-af25-42ca-9a18-e748662fbe79/assets/EL734160212_Trouble_stem_01.png" alt="This is an image of a mother bear with her two cubs." width="257" height="314"></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;“Oooh,” Kimwa said again. <span class="abbi-ttschunk">“Look!”</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;I was too busy looking myself to pay attention to Kimwa. But I wanted to share the excitement with her. I stood next to her, and together we let our eyes <span class="abbi-ttschunk">adjust</span> to the new world before us.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span> Large things reached right up to the sky, stretching out this way and that. Others were dressed in green, prickly fur. All about us was a jumble of tangled things—little ones, big ones, bushy ones, skinny ones. I couldn’t really tell where one stopped and the next started.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span>&nbsp;Then there were big and little lumps and mounds. Hard ones and softer ones, brown ones and gray ones. And beyond all that, the ground began to slope away, deeper and deeper. All the way along the slope were more tall and short things and more lumps and mounds.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">I</span> let my gaze travel off farther and farther. I saw an upward slope, and then another, and another. It seemed to go on forever.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">17</span>&nbsp;I could stand it no longer. “Mother,” I cried, tugging on one big shaggy paw. “What is it all?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">18</span>&nbsp;“Such impatience,” said Mother, but she was smiling.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">19</span>&nbsp;“Tell us. Tell us,” squealed Kimwa. I realized that she was as excited as I was.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">20</span>&nbsp;Mother smiled again. “You’ll learn all about it in time.”</p> <p class="center"><span class="abbi-hiddentts">* * *</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">21</span>&nbsp;We learned a lot that first morning. But it was later that day that Kimwa and I got some real lessons in life.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">22</span>&nbsp;Mother was leading us at a fast pace.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">23</span>&nbsp;“Where are we going?” I asked when I could catch my breath.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">24</span>&nbsp;“To the stream,” answered Mother.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">25</span>&nbsp;“What’s a stream?” puffed Kimwa, having as much trouble as I was trying to keep up.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">26</span>&nbsp;“You’ll see,” said Mother, and we had to be content with that.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">27</span>&nbsp;It was not easy making our way through the thick bushes and rocks. Both Kimwa and I puffed and panted as we hurried to keep up.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">28</span>&nbsp;Mother seemed to be in a hurry to get somewhere. As we rushed on, there was so much that I wanted to know about. But I didn’t have the time or the breath to ask her.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">29</span>&nbsp;It felt like we had been walking for hours. I was about to collapse when I noticed Mother’s steps slowing. I saw her head lift, and I knew that she was sniffing and listening carefully again.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">30</span> Mother grunted then—a happy kind of sound—and dropped back down on all fours. We began to move forward again. Mother always made sure it was safe for us.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">31</span>&nbsp;Soon I could hear a new sound. It was strange and low and gurgling. I wondered what kind of animal laughed like that. But it wasn’t an animal at all.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">32</span>&nbsp;“What’s that?” I asked in a whisper, not sure if I should be talking.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">33</span>&nbsp;“This is the stream,” said Mother. Without waiting a minute more, she walked right into it.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">34</span>&nbsp;Kimwa and I stopped in our tracks and stared. Would the strange stream gobble her up?</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">35</span>&nbsp;But Mother had stopped now, and she lowered her head and began to drink up the stream. She just kept drinking and drinking, and the stream kept flowing with water.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">36</span>&nbsp;At last, she stopped and looked at us. “Come,” she urged. “Come try the water.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">37</span>&nbsp;Kimwa lowered her black nose, and I put my first paw in. Kimwa tried to drink, but something went wrong. She jumped, sputtered, then choked and began to cough. I guessed Kimwa didn’t care much for the water.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">38</span>&nbsp;“Try slowly,” Mother said gently. “Little swallows, until you know how to drink.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">39</span>&nbsp;Kimwa was still shaking her head and giving little grunting coughs.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">40</span>&nbsp;“Like this,” said Mother. She lowered her head again to show us how it was done.</p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tn8items_convert/items/285/bdbdcefe-af25-42ca-9a18-e748662fbe79/assets/EL734160212_Trouble_stem_02.png" alt="This is an image of a mother bear searching for fish in the water as her bear cub watches." width="248" height="322"></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">41</span>&nbsp;It was my turn now. At first I just pretended to suck in a bit of the water. Then I actually took a sip. It was cold and didn’t really have a taste, but it felt good in my mouth. I reached down to take another sip.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">42</span>&nbsp;Suddenly, Kimwa came up from behind and gave me a hard push. I fell face first into the cold stream, sputtering and soaked!</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">43</span>&nbsp;“I’ll get you for that, little sister!” I yelled playfully.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">44</span>&nbsp;Kimwa and I wound up having a great water fight. Mother stayed off to the side, drinking when she was thirsty. But for <span class="abbi-ttschunk">Kimwa</span> and me, it turned out the stream was good for more than just drinking.</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em>Trouble in a Fur Coat</em> by Janette Oke.
