It has a large, heavy body, a short tail, and sharp claws on its four big paws. Bears are mammals, which are animals that feed milk to their young and have hair or fur on their bodies.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span>&nbsp;Most grizzly bears have brown fur. Sometimes the tips of the fur are white or silver, which gives the bears a grizzled, or gray, look. This is how the grizzly bear got its name.</p> <div class="boxText"> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Grizzly Bear Facts</h3> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>A grizzly bear lives for about 25 years.</li><li>Grizzlies sleep for up to eight months during the winter.</li><li>Grizzlies can run at 35 miles (56 km) per hour.</li></ul> </div> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">A Very Large Animal</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span> Grizzly bears are huge, bulky animals.

Most of them are in northern Canada and Alaska, where the winters are long and cold. Grizzly bears hibernate in winter. They dig a den in the ground to sleep in over the winter months.</p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tn8items_convert/items/285/a6c6b27f-49f7-469d-a4ae-f559857a9e7f/assets/EL623058877_Grizzly_Bear_stem_02.png" alt="This map of North America shows the number of grizzly bears living in different areas. Alaska 32,000 to 43,000. British Columbia 10,000 to 13,000. Washington 10 to 20. Idaho 20 to 30. Chihuahua possibly extinct. Yukon 6,000 to 7,000. Northwest Territories 4,000 to 5,000. Alberta 870. Montana 800 to 1,000. Wyoming 250 to 300. " width="583" height="330"></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;Grizzlies live near coasts and rivers, in grasslands and forests. These places are called habitats. Grizzlies live in places where there is plenty of food. They try to live away from people.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">What Do Grizzlies Eat?</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">7</span>&nbsp;Grizzly bears eat just about anything. They eat meat, leaves, berries, and even garbage. Grizzlies catch fish and also large prey, such as elk or moose.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;Grizzlies spend much of the spring and summer eating. They store food in their bodies as extra fat. The fat keeps the bears alive during the winter, when they are asleep.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Living Alone</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;A mother grizzly bear lives with her cubs until they are fully grown. Grizzlies that do not have cubs <span class="ssml-sub:liv" id="nlKi8">live</span> alone. Each bear has its own home range, which is the area it lives in. A bear’s home range may be very large.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;Grizzlies usually stay away from other bears. A grizzly bear marks its home range by rubbing its body against trees. This leaves a scent, which warns other grizzlies to keep away.</p> <div class="boxText"> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Getting Together</h3> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Grizzly bears sometimes gather&nbsp;together at a river. This often happens&nbsp;when the river contains plenty of&nbsp;salmon for all the grizzlies to eat.</li><li>A group of bears is called a sloth.</li></ul> </div> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Growing Up</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;A mother grizzly bear usually has two cubs at one time. The cubs are born in the den during the winter. At first, the cubs cannot see. A newborn cub is less than 12 inches (30 cm) long. It weighs less than one pound <span class="ssml-sub:450%20grams." id="NnrbH">(450 g).</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;Grizzly bear cubs grow quickly. In late spring, the family leaves the den to look for food. The cubs stay very close to their mother.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Enemies</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;Grizzly bears are so big and strong that most other animals keep out of their way. Wolves and cougars will kill bear cubs for food if cubs are left alone. A mother bear carefully protects her cubs from these predators.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span>&nbsp;Grizzlies do not often fight each other. They may fight over food, but there is usually enough food for all.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Under Threat</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span>&nbsp;At one time, grizzly bears lived in most parts of North America. When people moved into the bears’ habitats, the grizzly bears had to move out. Grizzlies do not like to live near towns, cities, or roads. Today, there are only a few grizzlies in the United States and southern Canada.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;People sometimes hunt grizzly bears because they are afraid of them, or just for sport. Hunters need a license to do this. It is against the law to hunt grizzlies without a license.</p> <div class="boxText"> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">Saving Grizzlies</h3> <p>In North America, there are many national parks&nbsp;and reserves where grizzly bears can live without&nbsp;being disturbed. People are not allowed to build&nbsp;roads or houses in these places.</p> </div></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em><br>Grizzly Bears (Amazing Animals) </em><span class="abbi-ttschunk">by Jacqueline Dineen.
