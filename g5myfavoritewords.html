And dogs with men who are just plain mean. Most dogs hope for a man they can understand. It’s great when you know what you’re supposed to do. Lewis knew exactly what I could do, and he let me do it. In fact, it got so that Lewis didn’t have to tell me what he wanted me to do. I knew.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span> Lewis would shoot an antelope, or some animal, and I’d wait. We’d watch it fall. . . . That’s when I’d retrieve the prey. Lewis didn’t have to say <span class="abbi-ttschunk">a word.</span> I knew what to do and when to do it.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span>&nbsp;Some men talk all the time, even when they’re not telling you what to do. Not Lewis. Lewis and I would walk to the top of a mountain and just stand there, him looking out over the view, and me with my nose high in the air. We didn’t say a word. We didn’t have to.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">4</span>&nbsp;For Lewis and me, it was more than just understanding each other. We suited each other perfectly. Only a few dogs are lucky enough to have a man who suits them like that. I’ve thought about that, why Lewis and I were so well suited. I’m not sure I know exactly.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">5</span>&nbsp;Lewis was a great man. I know that. The men knew it, too. They would do anything for Lewis. They loved him, especially Clark. I think Clark loved Lewis about as much as I did. I never heard Lewis or Clark say a harsh word to each other. And it was more than just getting along. They fit together, too. Of course that was different. They were both men. Dog and man can fit together like no others do. Lewis and I had that fit. By the end of our journey, we were as close as an animal and its hide.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;How did we get that close? I think the wilderness had something to do with it. Lewis and I would have been close anywhere, but the wilderness brought out the best in both of us. We were made for that territory.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">7</span>&nbsp;I was made for it in every way: my size, my fur, my paws, my instincts. I love running, hunting, swimming, and retrieving. I was happiest when I was doing those things.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;Lewis was happiest in the wilderness, too. Sometimes I think Lewis preferred the wilderness to people. He would spend hours looking at plants, examining animal specimens, and measuring the sky. He and I spent a lot of time hiking and exploring. We loved the stimulation of the wilderness. It was perfect for both of us.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;No dog could have a more perfect life than I had. My dreams let me <span class="abbi-ttschunk">relive</span> it over and over. They fill me with what I saw and what I did. I dream of . . .</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;Bears prowling around at night, keeping me awake.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;Lewis and I, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, smelling the salt air.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;Prickly pear cactus needles stuck in my paws, and Lewis tenderly pulling them out one by one.</p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tn8items_convert/items/285/d0014dd9-2acd-4873-b38d-cde6f25d5727/assets/EL800467632_Lewis_Clark_and_Me.png" alt="Meriwether Lewis walks with his dog, Seaman, near the banks of the Mississippi River." width="408" height="335"></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;And that triumphal return to St. Louis. Men, women, and children running to the docks to meet us. Dogs barking. Horses in an uproar. People shouting and cheering.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span>&nbsp;I look at Lewis. He looks at me. He’s smiling. He places his hand on my head. I push my head further into his hand. Then he says my favorite words.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span>&nbsp;“Good job, Seaman.”</p> <blockquote><div><strong>. . . my dog was of the newfoundland breed very active strong and docile . . .</strong></div><div><strong class="right">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meriwether Lewis&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong class="right">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;September 11, 1803</strong></div></blockquote> <div class="boxText"> <p class="passage-title"><strong>Historical Background</strong></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;Where Meriwether Lewis purchased Seaman is a mystery. Newfoundlands were popular along the East Coast, so two likely places are Washington, D.C., where <span class="ssml-sub:Louis" id="A6Smn">Lewis</span> lived and worked as Thomas Jefferson’s secretary, and Philadelphia, where he went to prepare for the expedition. Another possibility is Pittsburgh, where <span class="ssml-sub:Louis" id="wCY88">Lewis</span> actually began the journey. Seaman is first mentioned in Lewis’s journal on September 11, 1803, as they sailed on the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to St. Louis.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">17</span>&nbsp;For years writers called Lewis’s dog Scannon. This was not questioned until 1984, when Donald Jackson, a great Lewis and Clark scholar, was doing research about the rivers, streams, and creeks that Lewis and Clark had named. Every name had a meaning, but Jackson could not figure out “Seaman’s Creek” in Montana. He went back to the original drawings and writings and discovered that in Scannon, the <em>c</em> was actually an <em>e</em> and the <em>nn</em> was an <em>m</em>, thus “Scannon” was actually <em>Seaman</em>. Seaman’s Creek, now called Monture Creek, still exists in Montana.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">18</span>&nbsp;The last time Seaman is mentioned in a journal is July 15, 1806, in Montana when Lewis wrote:</p> <blockquote><div><strong>. . . the </strong><span id="K4wlo" class="glossary-term glossary-plugin" data-content="AMUao" data-title="Glossary Definition" data-placement="bottom" aria-label="musquetoes" tabindex="0" data-hasqtip="0" aria-haspopup="true" role="link"><strong>musquetoes</strong></span> <strong>continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist; . . . my dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them</strong><span class="abbi-hiddentts"><strong>, . . .</strong></span></div></blockquote> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">19</span>&nbsp;The expedition arrived back in St. Louis two months later, September 23, 1806. Although most scholars believed Seaman completed the journey (his death or loss would surely have been mentioned in one of the many journals), no one knew for certain until recently, when another Lewis and Clark scholar, Jim Holmberg, discovered a book written in 1814, which listed <span class="nobreak"><span id="G4sSD" class="glossary-term glossary-plugin" data-content="rEVVT" data-title="Glossary Definition" data-placement="bottom" aria-label="epitaphs and inscriptions" tabindex="0" data-hasqtip="1" aria-haspopup="true" role="link">epitaphs and inscriptions</span>.</span> The book lists an inscription on a dog collar (most likely destroyed in a fire) in a museum in Virginia. The inscription reads:</p> <blockquote><div><strong>The greatest traveller of my species. My name is SEAMAN, the dog of captain Meriwether Lewis, whom I accompanied to the Pacifick ocean through the interior of the continent of North America.</strong></div></blockquote> </div></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em><br>Lewis and Clark and Me: A Dog’s Tale</em> by Laurie Myers.
