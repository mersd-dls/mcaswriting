The dog race was just a few hours away. After that I had to play my guitar for a thousand strangers.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span>&nbsp;I wondered if my dad ever got scared, playing for a big crowd.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span>&nbsp;Bella barked to warn me of an intruder at the side door. Marty was right behind her.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">4</span>&nbsp;Woof-<em>woof</em>, <span class="abbi-ttschunk">woof-woof-<em>woof</em>!</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">5</span>&nbsp;Oink-<em>oink</em>, <span class="abbi-ttschunk">oink-oink-<em>oink</em>!</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;Pal let herself in, humming. She stole my waffle and covered it with Hershey’s. “I can’t wait to get up there in front of all those people,” she said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">7</span>&nbsp;“We better get in one last practice run.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;“Get your guitar then.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;“No, I mean for Marty.”</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="center"><span class="abbi-hiddentts">* * *</span></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;I’d laid out a mockup of the racecourse with bales and zigzag trails marked off with rolls of POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS tape Mr. Lee donated to the cause.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;Marty hurdled and climbed and wove through the obstacles in record time, until he got to the last hitch, the slide. It was from a swing set I found in a dumpster near one of John Mason’s construction sites.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;Marty climbed the straw bale steps to the top of the slide, and then like always he sat and stared out at the mountains.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;“When the time comes, he’ll do it,” Pal said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span>&nbsp;“Marty, come on, boy,” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span>&nbsp;He wouldn’t budge.</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="center"><span class="abbi-hiddentts">* * *</span></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;The rides spun and whirled all across the five-acre lot behind the Juliette water tower. Double and Mr. Lee came with Pal and me as we walked Marty up to the entry table. I had Marty on a leash, and people were snickering.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">17</span>&nbsp;“And how can I help you, son?” the man at the registration desk said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">18</span>&nbsp;“Name’s Lorenzo Ventura, and I’m racing Marty.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">19</span>&nbsp;The man checked me off his list. “Where’s the dog then?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">20</span>&nbsp;“Well, sir, this is Marty.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">21</span>&nbsp;“The <em>pig</em>?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">22</span>&nbsp;“Yup,” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">23</span>&nbsp;“Yessir,” Double said, putting his hand on my shoulder and standing as tall as he could.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">24</span>&nbsp;The man leaned back and scratched his beard. “I don’t know as we ever had a pig in the dog race,” he said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">25</span>&nbsp;“Is there any rule against it?” Pal said, dagger-eyed.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">26</span>&nbsp;“Well, I don’t believe so,” the man said. “Tell you what, we had a pet coyote run once.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">27</span>&nbsp;“There you go then,” Mr. Lee said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">28</span>&nbsp;“We made him wear a muzzle just in case,” the man said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">29</span>&nbsp;“Marty’s more likely to lick than bite,” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">30</span>&nbsp;Marty did a play bow, and then he nudged the man’s hand with his snout.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">31</span>&nbsp;“He wants you to pet him,” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">32</span>&nbsp;The man did, and Marty rolled over like a dog for a belly scratch. The man smiled. “I think we might have the makings for a fun race here. I don’t see any harm in letting him run. You know it’s five hundred <span class="ssml-sub:smacka%20ruse" id="hPQ7K">smackaroos</span> to enter, right? Plus a hundred-dollar no-aggression deposit. I trust you when you say he’s no attack dog type of pig, but if he so much as nips another contestant, you forfeit that hundred bucks, understand?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">33</span>&nbsp;I knew about the no-aggression rule. I wouldn’t have let Marty race otherwise. “You take cash?” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">34</span>&nbsp;“Depends on if it’s real or not.” He rubbed the bills between his fingers. “That’ll do nicely. Bring Marty to the chute over there. We’ll be getting started shortly.”</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="center"><span class="abbi-hiddentts">* * *</span></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">35</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">The course was on the football field. So many people crowded the fence, I couldn’t see daylight between them. I waited with Marty in the chute and checked out the other dogs—the dogs, I mean. It occurred to me that nasty old Mason might enter Keeth for the amusement of terrifying the crowd with a bloodbath.</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">36</span>&nbsp;This bunch of pups was all tail-waggers, about thirty dogs total. Some had been entered for a joke. How’s a stub­-leg Dachshund going to outrun a Great Dane? The laughing was louder than the cheering. Then I realized, everybody was laughing at Marty.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">37</span>&nbsp;I kneeled at his side and whispered, “No matter what happens, boy, I’m so proud of you.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">38</span>&nbsp;He licked me upside my face.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">39</span>&nbsp;The bell rang and the gates opened.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">40</span>&nbsp;Those dogs left Marty in the dust.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">41</span> People wolf-howled and jeered him, but he kept to his business. He ran hard as he could for the first bridge where two dogs had <span class="nobreak">stopped. . . .</span> Another stopped to lap puddle water. Marty trotted past them, over the bridge, into the funnel tube, which scared away another dog.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">42</span>&nbsp;I huffed and puffed to keep pace alongside Marty as he approached the traffic cones. The officials disqualified three more dogs there. One skipped the cones entirely. Another got into a wrestling match with a cone. Another stopped for a wiggly back scratch in the grass. But not Marty.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">43</span>&nbsp;He trotted through the cones, head high, eyes front. By now people were on his side, and it was like that Rocky movie, except they were chanting, <span class="ssml-sub:Marred-E" id="e8Imh">“Mar-<em>ty</em>,</span> <span class="ssml-sub:Marred-E" id="KmA3M">Mar-<em>ty</em>,</span> <span class="ssml-sub:Marred-E" id="PYHrb">Mar-<em>ty</em>!”</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">44</span>&nbsp;Another dog went after a chipmunk.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">45</span>&nbsp;Another jumped over the fence.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">46</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Another shimmied under the one-foot hurdle when he was supposed to go over it—you’re outta there! Marty cleared it with a dainty hop.</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">47</span>&nbsp;So it went toward the slide. It was from the fun house, a long wavy ramp. The dogs were in no hurry to go down. They sunned themselves on the deck at the top of the slide.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">48</span>&nbsp;Marty climbed the hay bales to the top. He sat and looked out over the fairgrounds and wagged his tail. I screamed, “Come on, Marty! C’mon boy!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">49</span>&nbsp;<span class="ssml-sub:Marred-E" id="R5ys1">“Mar-<em>ty</em>!</span> <span class="ssml-sub:Marred-E" id="tcULm">Mar-<em>ty</em>!”</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">50</span>&nbsp;I pointed to the finish line, where people waited with treats. “Marty, cookie!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">51</span>&nbsp;He dropped to his belly and slid down. His bulk stopped him just short of the end of the slide. He shook himself off and trotted toward the final straightaway.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">52</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Now that they saw the slide wasn’t the end of the world, five dogs scrambled down it. Four flew past Marty for the finish line. The fifth, a floppy-eared hound, wanted Marty to play with him. He looped circles around Marty like a satellite. Marty kept going—until somebody threw a bunch of hot dogs onto the final stretch.</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">53</span>&nbsp;No way was Marty going to pass that up, but neither were the four dogs in the lead. They came back for the frankfurters and hunted the grass for any they might have missed. Marty ate on the way, galloping toward the line. Now everybody was screaming his name.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">54</span>&nbsp;My 220-pound pig was in the lead, with thirty yards to go!</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">55</span>&nbsp;Twenty . . .</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">56</span>&nbsp;Fifteen . . .</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">57</span>&nbsp;Ten . . .</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">58</span>&nbsp;The four dogs who had packed up charged past Marty and over the line.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">59</span>&nbsp;Marty and his floppy-eared satellite were five yards from the line when the hound circled in front of him, a couple of feet shy of the finish, and then circled behind him.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">60</span>&nbsp;Marty crossed the line, and an official draped a purple ribbon with 5’s on it over that beautiful pig’s neck.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">61</span>&nbsp;I fell to my knees and hugged him. Pal kissed him, Mr. Lee slapped my back, Double was hollering I don’t know what because I couldn’t hear anything with all the cheering. Then one voice rang louder than the rest: “No sir, that ribbon’s mine!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">62</span>&nbsp;He was the owner of the floppy-eared hound who’d just missed the fifth-place prize, whatever it was. “This is a <em>dog</em> race,” he said. “No pigs allowed!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">63</span> He tried to take the ribbon from Marty, but the officials pushed him back. “The time to complain was before the race, not after your dog lost it,” one of them <span class="nobreak">said. . . .</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">64</span>&nbsp;“We’re having a fun time here,” the head official said. “Let’s all be happy about the money we raised for the hospital, Taylor.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">65</span>&nbsp;Mr. Taylor.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">66</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">I <em>knew</em> he looked familiar. The Taylors’ mailbox was less than two miles down the road from Maple Clutch, but the old man was such a hermit, I hadn’t seen him in years. I knew his sons, sort of. The Taylor brothers were a lot older than I <span class="nobreak">was. . . .</span></span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">67</span>&nbsp;“You stole my prize, boy,” Mr. Taylor said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">68</span>&nbsp;“Let’s go, son,” Double said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">69</span>&nbsp;“Renzo!” Chip-tooth Loretta Frietas just about tackled me. “Thank you!” she said. “If a pig can place in a dog race, anything’s possible. I’m totally going out for volleyball again. They turned me down three times already, but as the saying goes, the fourth time’s a charm.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">70</span>&nbsp;It was actually the third time’s a charm, but I said, “Hey Retta? You’ll make it this time, I have a good feeling.” I did, too.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">71</span>&nbsp;The mayor called me to the stage and gave me the prize Marty won, a <span class="ssml-sub:wide%20screen" id="Bf9Ir">widescreen</span> TV.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">72</span>&nbsp;“That one goes for $419.99 at the <span id="mVXWV" class="glossary-term glossary-plugin" data-content="UclOb" data-title="Glossary Definition" data-placement="bottom" aria-label="Wal" tabindex="0" data-hasqtip="0" aria-haspopup="true" role="link">Wal</span>,” Double said. “They’ll let me return it no receipt, take it down ten percent for the restock, add the tax back in, you’re walking out of there with $400 cash money in your pocket.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">73</span>&nbsp;“We only lost a hundred bucks!” Pal said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">74</span>&nbsp;“<em>Yesss!</em>” I said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">75</span>&nbsp;Her dad hugged us, and Double hugged some lady he didn’t know, and everybody was hugging everybody.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">76</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Juliette was a rust belt town like Kishux Falls, and people were struggling—but not today. Today they had hope. They had Marty.</span></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em>Saving Marty</em> by Paul Griffin.
