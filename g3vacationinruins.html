That’s when Tomas and I decided we’d head to the pool.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span>&nbsp;“Are you excited about a whale watching trip?” I asked Tomas.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span>&nbsp;“Sure.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It sounds like fun. Something different, you know?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">4</span>&nbsp;“What if we go all the way out on the bay, spend hours on the water, and we don’t see anything?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">5</span>&nbsp;Tomas thought for a second.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;“I guess it’s just a plain old boat ride then.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">7</span>&nbsp;I chuckled a little bit.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;“I thought it would be more fun to go mountain biking.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;Tomas agreed with me. We knew the whale watching trip was Mom’s idea. Our mother is a bird biologist but she loves to experience anything remotely scientific.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;“Going whale watching will make Mom happy,” Tomas decided.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;I knew he was right.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;“It won’t kill us to make her happy,” I said sarcastically. Tomas knew I was playing and gave me a crooked grin.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;<span class="ssml-sub:Ola%2C%20nee%C3%B1yo%26%2339%3Bs!%20Mom%20waved%20to%20us%20as%20she%20walked%20across%20the%20pool%20deck.%20Were%20all%20set%20for%20whale%20watching!" id="LNlFm">“<em>Hola, niños!</em>” Mom waved to us as she walked across the pool deck. “We’re all set for whale watching!”</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span>&nbsp;Dad followed behind Mom with travel brochures and maps spilling out of his arms. Boy, did he look like the typical clueless tourist.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span>&nbsp;“We leave in an hour. Better head back to the hotel room and clean up,” Mom said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;Tomas grabbed his towel. I hopped out of the pool and dried off too.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">17</span>&nbsp;As we walked back to the hotel room, Mom rattled off instructions.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">18</span>&nbsp;“You’ll need a hat, sunscreen, a bottle of water, and a snack,” Mom said. “Don’t forget the camera, Marisol.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">19</span>&nbsp;“Got it, Mom,” I answered. She knew that Tomas and I never forgot the camera, but she always felt the need to remind one of us.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">20</span>&nbsp;When we met our boat captain later that afternoon, Mom and Dad told us that we’d remember this trip for the rest of our lives.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">21</span>&nbsp;“Marisol, Tomas, our captain has been tracking whales for 20 years. He knows exactly where to find them.” Dad smiled proudly at us. “We’re sure to spot them!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">22</span>&nbsp;“Or, it will be just a really long, really boring boat ride,” Tomas muttered in my ear. I tried not to burst out laughing. Tomas did have a point. Mountain biking would have been much more fun.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">23</span>&nbsp;The boat chugged out to Banderas Bay. Gulls screeched overhead as they dipped closer to us, looking for scraps of food. The water was rough and choppy as we moved further from the shore. Dad looked a little funny.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">24</span>&nbsp;“Excuse me, excuse me,” Dad grumbled as he elbowed through the crowd of tourists. He shoved harder and practically ran to the side of the ship.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">25</span>&nbsp;Dad folded himself over the railing. “UUUHHHBLEKKK.”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">26</span>&nbsp;After a minute or two, he pulled himself upright carefully. He looked pale and clammy. Mom rushed to his side. Some of the other passengers stared at Dad.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">27</span>&nbsp;“Honey, honey,” Mom said delicately. “Did you get seasick?”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">28</span>&nbsp;Dad nodded and let Mom lead him over to a bench.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">29</span>&nbsp;“That’s embarrassing. Can you believe he did that? In front of everyone?” I said to Tomas.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">30</span>&nbsp;“Nope. There’s no end to our embarrassment,” Tomas replied.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">31</span>&nbsp;Mom wiped Dad’s face with a cool, wet handkerchief.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">32</span>&nbsp;“You’ll get your sea legs yet, sweetie. Don’t worry,” she told him. Dad didn’t usually travel by boat and the ship’s rocking motion made him sick.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">33</span>&nbsp;The captain walked by Dad. He stopped and stared at our sad, seasick father.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">34</span>&nbsp;“<em>Señor</em>, you look like you need help,” he said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">35</span>&nbsp;Dad nodded weakly.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">36</span>&nbsp;“Try these. Suck on these candies all day. Your sea sickness will go away. I promise,” he said.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">37</span>&nbsp;Dad took the handful of candies from the captain. He leaned against the ship’s wall and closed his eyes. Mom came over to talk to me and Tomas.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">38</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">“Kids, this might be a rough day for your father. Try to be good. Take it easy on him,” Mom patted my shoulder and smiled tenderly over at Dad. He still looked horrible—like a sick, miserable dog in a shelter cage.</span></p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/previewer-prd-tn8-resources/items/285/268899b8-9972-4262-b637-d2dcf21c4a69/assets/EL901158691_VacationRuins_stem_02.png" alt="The picture shows a girl standing in a boat.

Everyone on the ship shifted to the starboard side.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">40</span>&nbsp;I had the camera, ready to capture the whale. The ship rocked harder. Dad moaned louder and gripped his stomach. A long, gray snout came out of the water. I clicked the camera. Sea water sprayed my face. I heard Tomas shouting excitedly, “The blow hole, the blow hole! There it is!” I changed position and tried to focus the camera on the whale’s blow hole.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">41</span> Another long, gray snout emerged. “Two whales, Marisol! Two!” Tomas jumped up and <span class="nobreak">down. . . .</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">42</span>&nbsp;The giant humpback whales seemed curious. They studied us just as we studied them.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">43</span>&nbsp;Tomas reached over the side of the ship. His fingers inched closer to the whale’s snout. The whale opened his mouth. Tomas flipped over the ship’s railing. Splash!</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">44</span>&nbsp;“<em>Dios mio</em>,” a woman screamed.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">45</span>&nbsp;Mom rushed to the railing, “Tomas, Tomas!” She was frantic.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">46</span>&nbsp;I started climbing over the railing to rescue Tomas. A firm tug jerked me back. It was the captain.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">47</span>&nbsp;“No, <em>señorita</em>!” The captain shook his finger at me. Quick as a fox, the captain grabbed a life preserver and leaned over the railing.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">48</span>&nbsp;“Young man, young man! Where are you?” the captain shouted.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">49</span>&nbsp;The two humpback whales submerged and reappeared. Where was Tomas?</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">50</span>&nbsp;Mom screamed out to the sea, calling for Tomas. Where was he? Was he gone?</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">51</span>&nbsp;A moment later, a dark, round head popped above the waves. Thankfully, Tomas had a life jacket on. The life jacket helped him keep his head above the waves.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">52</span>&nbsp;“There he is! There he is!” I yelled to the captain. Tomas had floated about thirty feet away from the boat.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">53</span>&nbsp;The whales noticed that someone had joined them in the water. They swam toward Tomas.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">54</span>&nbsp;“They’re going to eat him! Help!” I screamed. With one gulp, a humpback whale could swallow Tomas whole.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">55</span>&nbsp;Everyone on board the ship grew quiet. No one could save the little boy from being eaten by a giant whale. We were terrified.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">56</span>&nbsp;Tomas saw the whales coming toward him. They circled him. Tomas reached his arms out to pet the whales. Are you crazy? I wanted to scream at Tomas but I was too afraid to move a muscle, let alone open my mouth.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">57</span>&nbsp;Tomas stroked the whales’ sides. I could see Tomas smiling. He was having fun. Now? At a time like this? I thought.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">58</span>&nbsp;Tomas paddled his arms to position himself in front of one of the whales. “Perfect! It will open its mouth and gobble you for sure,” I yelled. My father fainted.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">59</span>&nbsp;Tomas bobbed up and down in the water. The whale submerged. With the force of the water, the waves around the whale bounced Tomas closer to our boat. The passengers cheered.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">60</span>&nbsp;The captain wasted no time. He waved a rope over his head and lassoed Tomas’s life preserver with the rope.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">61</span>&nbsp;“Swim to me,” the captain shouted. As Tomas swam, the captain pulled. And pulled. And pulled.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">62</span>&nbsp;Dropping an emergency ladder down the side of the ship, the captain leaned toward Tomas.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">63</span>&nbsp;“Climb, boy!”</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">64</span>&nbsp;Tomas heaved himself to the ladder and <span class="abbi-ttschunk">dragged</span> himself up to the railing. I grabbed his arms and pulled him on deck.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">65</span> Mom rushed to Tomas, covering him in kisses. I wrapped my arms around him and squeezed him <span class="nobreak">tight. . . .</span> “I haven’t lost a passenger yet. I wasn’t about to let you be the first.” Tomas stepped toward the captain and gave him a huge hug.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">66</span>&nbsp;“Thanks, Captain,” he whispered.</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em>A Vacation in Ruins</em> by Precious McKenzie.
