From its rounded snout, it flicks its long, forked tongue in and out of its mouth. Its massive body is covered in what looks like armor. Its long, sharp claws look as though they could rip anything apart. It’s easy to see how this animal, the Komodo dragon, earned its name.</p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/previewer-prd-tn8-resources/items/285/86b1aa64-ca4a-439f-8029-505e51976daf/assets/EL901116349_Komodo_stem_01.png" alt="The photograph shows a Komodo dragon crawling on the ground with its tongue sticking out." width="320" height="264"></p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">DRAGON MYTH AND REALITY</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="ssml-sub:Youve%20probably%20red%20about%20dragons%20in%20storybooks.These%20dragons%20fly%20through%20the%20air.%20They%20breathe%20fire.%20They%20may%20stand%20guard%20over%20a%20maiden%20in%20a%20tower.%20These%20dragons%20are%20myths." id="ux3SO">You’ve probably read about dragons in storybooks.&nbsp;These dragons fly through the air. They breathe fire. They may stand guard over a maiden in a tower. These dragons are myths.</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">3</span> The Komodo dragon was once thought to be just a myth. Stories of a dragon-like creature living on the island of Komodo in Indonesia spread for many years. Local people called it a “land crocodile.” Until about 100 years ago, no outside scientist had actually seen the creature. When one scientist finally saw the huge beasts with his own eyes, he named it Komodo dragon, after the creatures of myth.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">A BEAST AMONG LIZARDS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">4</span>&nbsp;Komodo dragons are lizards. Lizards are a type of reptile. All reptiles have dry, scaly skin. Scientists further divide lizards into groups. Komodo dragons are a kind of monitor lizard. The carnivorous monitors have powerful jaws. Their tails are long and whiplike. Komodo dragons are the largest and heaviest lizards on Earth.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">THE ISLAND GIANTS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">5</span>&nbsp;How did Komodo dragons become the largest lizards on Earth? One idea is that early relatives of these creatures once lived on a large continent. These early lizards were much smaller. Then they began moving to islands. With more prey and fewer predators, the lizards’ offspring slowly became larger and larger.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">COLD-BLOODED CREATURES</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">6</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">All reptiles are cold-blooded. They cannot make their own body heat. Komodo dragons spend lots of time in the sun to keep warm. At night or during rain, they may hide in a lair—an underground burrow that keeps them warm.</span></p></div><div class="abbi-image"><p class="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/previewer-prd-tn8-resources/items/285/86b1aa64-ca4a-439f-8029-505e51976daf/assets/EL901116349_Komodo_stem_02.png" alt="The first map shows the islands that are the range of the Komodo dragon.

Five small islands in Indonesia make up their range. Komodo, Rinca, Gili Dasami, Gili Montang, and Flores are home to this animal.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">8</span>&nbsp;Komodo is the largest of the islands. It is just <span class="ssml-sub:one%20hundred%20fifty" id="CJHmN">150</span><span class="abbi-ttschunk"> square miles</span> <span class="ssml-sub:two%20hundred%20forty%20one" id="cItl4">(241</span> square <span class="ssml-sub:kilometers" id="Rk0Ei">km).</span> Two Komodo Islands could fit in New York City!</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">9</span>&nbsp;The land where this lizard roams is rugged and hilly. Parts of the islands are forests with dense plant life. The weather is dry and hot. The islands get little to no rainfall eight months out of the year. During the day it averages 95 degrees Fahrenheit <span class="nobreak">(35 degrees</span> Celsius). Komodos thrive in this heat. Sometimes Komodos trek up the mountains and ridgetops where the air is cooler and moist.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">GROUND DWELLERS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">10</span>&nbsp;Many other lizards live in trees. Komodo dragons dwell on the ground. On the ground they bask in the heat of the sun. They watch for prey in dry grasslands and forests. At night they retreat to their lairs.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">FIGHTING FOR LAND</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">11</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Komodo dragons like hanging out alone. Their small lairs are just large enough for one dragon. In the day they roam and hunt alone. While roaming, a dragon stays in a certain area. Each dragon’s territory depends on its size. An average adult covers about <span class="nobreak">1.2 square miles</span> (2 square </span><span class="ssml-sub:kilometers" id="YyZMl">km)</span> every day.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">12</span>&nbsp;However, this territory does not belong entirely to one Komodo. Territories often overlap. Though they hunt alone, when a Komodo takes down large prey, other dragons will often gather together to feed.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">FIGHTING DRAGONS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">13</span>&nbsp;A dragon’s size determines its dominance within a territory. Males may fight to prove who is the most powerful. Using their muscular tails as support, male dragons stand tall on their hind legs to attack. With their front legs, the dragons wrestle. They attempt to throw each other to the ground. These attacks are often violent and bloody.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">EATING LIKE A DRAGON</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">14</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Komodo dragons are not picky eaters. They will eat just about any animal they find. Larger Komodos hunt deer, water buffalo, and wild boar. Smaller Komodo dragons eat rodents, birds, and eggs. Sometimes they eat smaller lizards—including other Komodos! They scavenge for dead animals as well.</span></p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">TONGUE DETECTIVES</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">15</span> The Komodo dragon picks up scents in the air with its tongue. The tongue can detect prey up to 3.1 miles (5 km) away. The Komodo can tell the direction of an animal based on what side of its tongue picked up a stronger scent. After each flick in and out of its mouth, the Komodo rubs its tongue along the roof of its mouth. Particles from the scent touch special organs. The organs detect even faint traces of a nearby animal’s <span class="nobreak">scent. . . .</span></p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">TIME TO EAT!</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">16</span>&nbsp;<span class="abbi-ttschunk">Once their prey is at hand, Komodo dragons eat incredibly quickly. They may eat up to 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg) of meat in a single minute. They have amazing appetites as well. Some Komodos have been known to eat 80 percent of their body weight in a single feeding. Because they eat so much at one time, Komodos don’t have to eat very often. Some only eat about once a month.</span></p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">17</span>&nbsp;The dominant Komodo gets to eat first at a kill. Smaller dragons have to wait their turn. They often must pick at whatever remains of the prey. Because Komodo dragons are so solitary in nature, group feedings are one of the few times that males and females are together.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">18</span> Well fed, the Komodo dragon can relax. It has no predators of its own. There are no predators in their habitat that are bigger or more dangerous than the Komodo. They are at the top of their food <span class="nobreak">chain. . . .</span></p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">GROWING UP DRAGON</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">19</span>&nbsp;Newly hatched Komodo dragons are about <span class="nobreak">12 inches</span> <span class="nobreak">(30 centimeters)</span> long. They weigh about 3.5 ounces (100 grams). Almost immediately after hatching, the baby dragons run away from the nest. They race to the top of a nearby tree. They must avoid being eaten by their mother or other Komodos!</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">20</span>&nbsp;For another eight months, the young dragons live in trees. They grow large, eating bugs, eggs, small lizards, and birds. As they grow, they also change color. Greenish in color when they hatch, they become gray or reddish-brown as they age.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">21</span>&nbsp;The larger they get, the more time Komodo dragons will spend on the ground. But younger dragons still face danger below. Although adult Komodos have no predators, young dragons do. Large snakes, wild boars, and other animals may prey on them.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">22</span>&nbsp;By the time they are 4 years old, young Komodos are about 4 feet (1.2 m) long. They have grown large enough to leave the safety of the trees and live on the ground. Komodo dragons reach adulthood at about 9 or 10 years old. They can expect a long life for a lizard. In the wild Komodos may live up to 30 years.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">DRAGONS IN DANGER</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">23</span>&nbsp;Without any predators, it may seem like the Komodo dragon is safe from any threat. But there are only about 3,000 Komodo dragons living in the wild. Only about 600 of those are females capable of laying eggs. With these low numbers, the fate of this animal is in question.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">THREATS TO DRAGONS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">24</span>&nbsp;One threat facing this animal is the destruction of their homes. As people cut through land, they tear down the plants that the Komodo uses to camouflage itself. The animal population dwindles as humans hunt both Komodos and their prey. With a limited food source, Komodos have more difficulty finding their next meals.</p> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">25</span>&nbsp;As their food sources decline, some Komodos resort to eating livestock. When this happens, some farmers see the Komodos as pests. To protect their livestock, some farmers bait the Komodos with poisoned meat, killing them.</p> <h3 class="semantic-marker passage-subheading">HOPE FOR DRAGONS</h3> <p><span class="badge badge-inverse abbi-hiddentts">26</span>&nbsp;Today most Komodos live in protected areas. Komodo National Park opened in 1980 in Indonesia. The park protects Komodo dragons and other wildlife. Scientists at zoos have worked to breed Komodos. Some of these Komodos may be released into the wild. Strict laws against <span id="KGdV3" class="glossary-term glossary-plugin" data-content="jrrBK" data-title="Glossary Definition" data-placement="bottom" aria-label="poaching" tabindex="0" data-hasqtip="0" aria-haspopup="true" role="link">poaching</span> help protect this lizard. As more people take an interest in the fate of these rare dragons, their futures may be saved. Komodo dragons are not myths. It is up to us to prevent the last of our real-life dragons from disappearing.</p></div><div class="abbi-richtext"><p class="copyright-tm"><em>Komodo Dragons</em> by Jill Sherman.
